<h2>phpPerfCheck</h2>
<p>
This could be a big mistake.  I has misgivings about my VPS provider, there are transient performance behaviours that I cannot fathom.  In order to test the platform I have created a little php exercise for the server.  I won't (shouldn't) take more than a tenth of a second and hopefully will crudely highlight concerning responses.  Included is a node.js poller and a plain jane results page.
